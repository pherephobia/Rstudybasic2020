## Instructions

In the real test, you should be logged in as guest (username = "gast", password = "gast"). On your desktop you will find all supplied data and supplements, as well as the submit script `submit_your_work`.  For this training test, simply quit your browser and time your work; in the real exam, you will have two hours to solve a set of similar questions.
Use the supplied R markdown file `TRAINING_EXAM.Rmd` to solve and answer the questions of this test. Fill in your name and student number in the header of this document. **Note: never use `echo = False` in your code chunk headers.**  
All questions have the possible number of points to be scored indicated. your grade will be calculated as  
$Grade = 1 + (\frac{PointsScored}{MaximumScore} * 9)$  

After finishing, `knit` the result into a pdf document and rename it to `TRAINING_EXAM_YOUR_NAME.pdf`.


## Data description

This test explores a dataset containing measurements of several food constituents in a variety of foods, categorized over several groups.   

### Code "Book"

These are the columns, and their descriptions, included in the data file `food_constituents.txt`:  
id.nr	Type	kcal	protein	carb.total	carb.sugar	carb.other	fat.total	fat.sat	fat.unsat	fiber	Na 
2	chocolate	442	5.00	67.40	64.60	2.80	15.50	9.00	6.50	6.60	0.100

1. **id.nr** simple measurement counter
2. **Type** food group
3. **kcal** energy contents in kcal/100g product
3. **protein** protein content in g/100g product
4. **carb.total** total carbohydrate content in g/100g product
5. **carb.sugar** sugar carbohydrates in g/100g product
6. **carb.other** other carbohydrates in g/100g product
7. **fat.total** total fat content in g/100g product
8. **fat.sat** saturated fats in g/100g product
9. **fat.unsat** unsaturated fats in g/100g product
10. **fiber** fiber contents in g/100g product
11. **Na** Sodium content in g/100g product


# Here starts the actual test

## Part 1: Data loading and cleaning

#### Question 1 (10 points)

Load the data from file `food_constituents.txt` and assign it to a variable called `foods`. Take special care with missing/invalid fields, and also make sure the columns are loaded in the right data type. 

```{r}
#your code here
```


If you fail to load the data as instructed above, you may load the pre-processed file using the following code chunk (uncomment the R code). Make sure your working directory is set appropriately! You will not get any points for this question, however.

```{r}
## Uncomment this line to load pre-processed data
#load("./foods_raw.Rdata")
```


#### Question 2 (5 points)

There are several rows with missing data. Report these and also remove these from the `foods` dastaset. Hint: use the function `complete.cases()` to achieve this.

```{r}
#your code here
```


## Part 2: Data exploration

#### Question 3 (6 points)


**Question 3 a (2 points)** What is the average caloric value of this food listing?

```{r}
#your code here
```


**Question 3 b (2 points)** Tabulate the frequencies of the different food categories (e.g. Type)

```{r}
#your code here
```


**Question 3 c (2 points)** Show the "6-number summary" for -only- the fat measurements.

```{r}
#your code here
```


#### Question 4 (12 points)

**Question 4 a (4 points)** Create a new column called `fat.cat` that divides the foods into 3 food categories based on total fat content: `high.fat`, `medium.fat` and `low.fat`. Take into account that this is an ordinal scale!.

```{r}
#your code here
```

If you are not able to create this factor, load it from file and attach it to your foods dataframe. You will not get points for this question of course.

```{r}
##uncomment this if you could not create the factor yourself
#load("foods_fat_cat.RData")
```


**Question 4 b (4 points)** Calculate mean energy content for each fat.cat category.

```{r}
#your code here
```


**Question 4 c (8 points) -Challenge question-** Report which foods from each fat.cat group have the largest fraction of saturated fat relative to total fat. 

```{r}
#your code here
```

Is there anything funny in these results? Discuss/explain these!


#### Question 5 (8 points)

Sort (and list) the Pasta foods by energy content, from high to low.

```{r}
#your code here
```


## Part 3: Visualization


#### Question 6 (8 points)

Create a -well annotated- box plot showing distributions of total total carbohydrate content for the three fat categories (low.fat, medium.fat and high.fat).

```{r}
#your code here
```


#### Question 7 (15 points)

Create a -well annotated- scatter plot exploring the total carbohydrate content relative to energy content. You should add a linear regression line to emphasise the relationship.

```{r}
#your code here
```

Is there a clear relationship as you would expect?
If not, can you explain?
